                <p>My name is Aaron Booth. I am 30 years old and I have a wife and three kids I currently work a full
                    time
                    job
                    and am enrolled in this class. I also am a part-time crossfit coach It has been my dream to always
                    be a
                    programmer, but when I was 20 years old I had my first child and being a new parent with full time
                    school
                    and a full time job was overwhelming. I had no choice but to commit to providing for my family by
                    working my
                    way up in retail.</p>

                <p>Every year I try to stick by a new years resolution, previously it was going from 230lb to 160. I
                    have
                    always dreamed of going back to school, but was always too scared to make the commitment. I heard
                    about
                    coding bootcamp a few years ago from a friend of mine who mastered in robotics at nc state. It was
                    very
                    preliminary and bootcamps were just starting to be established and recognized so I was very hesitant
                    to
                    commit to something like that without knowing if a bootcamp program could get me the career I've
                    dreamed
                    of. This year I told myself I finally wanted to get out of retail and pursue other things; Although
                    retail was the only thing I have had professional experience with.</p>

                <p>I joined a crossfit gym a few years ago and with that you get to know a vast variety of people. One
                    of my
                    friends that I met she works at bank of america in a tech division I told her I had previous
                    interest in
                    programming and that i pursued it before i had kids. When I talked to her she told me about the UNCC
                    coding bootcamp program and that they hire from that and its a really good program. With her telling
                    me
                    that it reaffirmed what my friend had told me about bootcamps a few years ago it just clicked. I
                    knew I
                    had to do this for myself and my family.</p>
