            <p>My name is Aaron Booth. I am 30 years old and I have a wife and three kids I currently work a full time
                job
                and am enrolled in this class. I also am a part-time crossfit coach It has been my dream to always be a
                programmer, but when I was 20 years old I had my first child and being a new parent with full time
                school
                and a full time job was overwhelming. I had no choice but to commit to providing for my family by
                working my
                way up in retail.</p>

            <p>Every year I try to stick by a new years resolution, previously it was going from 230lb to 160. I have
                always dreamed of going back to school, but was always too scared to make the commitment. I heard about
                coding bootcamp a few years ago from a friend of mine who mastered in robotics at nc state. It was very
                preliminary and bootcamps were just starting to be established and recognized so I was very hesitant to
                commit to something like that without knowing if a bootcamp program could get me the career I've dreamed
                of. This year I told myself I finally wanted to get out of retail and pursue other things; Although
                retail was the only thing I have had professional experience with.</p>

            <p>I joined a crossfit gym a few years ago and with that you get to know a vast variety of people. One of my
                friends that I met she works at bank of america in a tech division I told her I had previous interest in
                programming and that i pursued it before i had kids. When I talked to her she told me about the UNCC
                coding bootcamp program and that they hire from that and its a really good program. With her telling me
                that it reaffirmed what my friend had told me about bootcamps a few years ago it just clicked. I knew I
                had to do this for myself and my family.</p>
