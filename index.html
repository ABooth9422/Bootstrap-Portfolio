                <p class="mx-3">My name is Aaron Booth. I am 30 years old and I have a wife and three kids I currently
                    work a
                    full-time job and am enrolled in this class. I also am a part-time crossfit coach It has been my
                    dream to
                    always be a programmer, but when I was 20 years old I had my first child and being a new parent with
                    full
                    time school and a full time job was overwhelming. I had no choice but to commit to providing for my
                    family
                    by working my way up in retail. Every year I try to stick by a new years resolution, previously it
                    was going
                    from 230lb to 160.
                    I have always dreamed of going back to school, but was always too scared to make the
                    commitment.I
                    heard about
                    coding bootcamp a few years ago from a friend of mine who mastered in robotics at nc state.

            <div class="row ml-auto">
                <p>       It was
                        very
                        preliminary and bootcamps were just starting to be established and recognized so I was very
                        hesitant
                        to
                        commit to something like that without knowing if a bootcamp program could get me the career I've
                        dreamed
                        of.
                    
                    This year I told myself I finally wanted to get out of retail and pursue other things. Although
                    retail was the only thing I have had professional experience with.</p>

                <p>I joined a crossfit gym a few years ago and with that you get to know a vast variety of people.
                    One
                    of my
                    friends that I met she works at bank of america in a tech division I told her I had previous
                    interest in
                    programming and that i pursued it before i had kids.</p>


                <p> When I talked to her she told me about the UNCC
                    coding bootcamp program and that they hire from that and its a really good program.</p>


                <p>With her telling
                    me
                    that it reaffirmed what my friend had told me about bootcamps a few years ago it just clicked. I
                    knew I
                    had to do this for myself and my family.</p>
