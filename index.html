                    <p>My name is Aaron Booth. I am 30 years old and I have a wife and three kids I currently work a
                        full
                        time
                        job
                        and am enrolled in this class. I also am a part-time crossfit coach It has been my dream to
                        always
                        be a
                        programmer, but when I was 20 years old I had my first child and being a new parent with full
                        time
                        school
                        and a full time job was overwhelming. I had no choice but to commit to providing for my family
                        by
                        working my
                        way up in retail. Every year I try to stick by a new years resolution, previously it was going
                        from 230lb to 160. </p>

                    <p> I have always dreamed of going back to school, but was always too scared to make the
                        commitment.I
                        heard about
                        coding bootcamp a few years ago from a friend of mine who mastered in robotics at nc state. </p>

                <div class="col-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4">
                    <p>It was
                        very
                        preliminary and bootcamps were just starting to be established and recognized so I was very
                        hesitant
                        to
                        commit to something like that without knowing if a bootcamp program could get me the career I've
                        dreamed
                        of.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4">
                    <p>This year I told myself I finally wanted to get out of retail and pursue other things; Although
                        retail was the only thing I have had professional experience with.</p>

                    <p>I joined a crossfit gym a few years ago and with that you get to know a vast variety of people.
                        One
                        of my
                        friends that I met she works at bank of america in a tech division I told her I had previous
                        interest in
                        programming and that i pursued it before i had kids.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p> When I talked to her she told me about the UNCC
                        coding bootcamp program and that they hire from that and its a really good program.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p>With her telling
                        me
                        that it reaffirmed what my friend had told me about bootcamps a few years ago it just clicked. I
                        knew I
                        had to do this for myself and my family.</p>
